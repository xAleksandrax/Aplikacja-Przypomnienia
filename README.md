The Reminder application is a simple project written in Python using the Django framework. It allows users to add, browse, edit, and delete reminders. After logging in, a user can add new reminders by entering a title and description. Each reminder also includes information about the creation date and whether it has been completed. Reminders are stored in a database and assigned to a specific user.

The Reminder application uses Django's authentication and authorization mechanisms, which means that users must log in to add and edit reminders. Additionally, each user can only view their own reminders. The application is also protected against CSRF and XSS attacks.
